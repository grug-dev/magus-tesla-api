# telemetry Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change telemetry-add-nightly-snapshots. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Nightly Vehicle Snapshot Capture
The telemetry capability SHALL capture one immutable snapshot of every registered vehicle
across all accounts on each scheduled run. In addition to the fields already required,
the snapshot SHALL also store the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) readings for all
four corners of the vehicle (front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right) in bar, the
Tesla Fleet API's native unit for tire pressure. These four fields SHALL be stored as
nullable values; a NULL value means the vehicle did not report TPMS at capture (e.g. the
vehicle has no TPMS sensors, or the field was absent in the response) OR the row predates
this extraction, and a NULL value SHALL NOT be interpreted as zero pressure. A truthfully
reported 0.0 bar SHALL be stored as a non-NULL value. All other snapshot requirements
(raw_data, append-only, miles storage, Km-companion derivation, sentry-mode fidelity)
remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: A snapshot captures TPMS pressure for all four corners
- **GIVEN** a registered vehicle that is parked and its vehicle_data reports
  tpms_pressure_fl, tpms_pressure_fr, tpms_pressure_rl, and tpms_pressure_rr values in
  bar when the nightly snapshot is captured
- **WHEN** a collection cycle captures the snapshot
- **THEN** the stored snapshot includes non-NULL values for all four TPMS pressure fields
- **AND** each stored value matches the corresponding value reported by the vehicle (in
  bar, the API-native unit)
- **AND** the snapshot's raw_data still contains the full vehicle_data payload

#### Scenario: A snapshot stores NULL TPMS pressure when the vehicle does not report TPMS
- **GIVEN** a registered vehicle whose vehicle_data does not include TPMS pressure values
  at capture time (e.g. the vehicle has no TPMS sensors)
- **WHEN** a collection cycle captures the snapshot
- **THEN** the stored TPMS pressure fields on the snapshot are NULL for all four corners
- **AND** all existing snapshot fields (battery level, range, odometer, etc.) are still
  populated normally

#### Scenario: A truthfully reported zero bar pressure is stored as non-NULL
- **GIVEN** a registered vehicle that reports a TPMS pressure of exactly 0.0 bar for
  one or more corners (e.g. a flat tire)
- **WHEN** a collection cycle captures the snapshot
- **THEN** the stored TPMS pressure value for the affected corner is non-NULL
- **AND** the stored value is 0.0 bar (not NULL — zero is a truthful reading)

#### Scenario: Pre-extraction snapshot rows have NULL for the TPMS pressure fields
- **GIVEN** a vehicle_snapshots row written before the TPMS column migration was applied
- **WHEN** a caller reads that snapshot through the telemetry read port
- **THEN** the four TPMS pressure fields on the Snapshot are NULL
- **AND** the caller can still access the raw_data payload to extract the TPMS values
  retroactively if needed

### Requirement: Waking Sleeping Vehicles Within A Bounded Timeout
The telemetry capability SHALL wake a sleeping vehicle before capturing it, polling for the vehicle
to come online within a bounded, configurable timeout. If the vehicle comes online within the
timeout, the capability SHALL capture its snapshot. If the vehicle does not come online before the
timeout expires, the capability SHALL record the attempt as a failure with a wake-timeout reason
and SHALL NOT keep waking that vehicle for the rest of the run.

#### Scenario: A sleeping vehicle wakes in time and is captured
- **GIVEN** a registered vehicle that is asleep at the start of the cycle and comes online within
  the wake timeout
- **WHEN** the collection cycle processes it
- **THEN** the vehicle is asked to wake
- **AND** once it reports online its snapshot is captured and stored
- **AND** its attempt is recorded as a success

#### Scenario: A vehicle that never wakes in time is recorded and skipped
- **GIVEN** a registered vehicle that is asleep and does not come online before the wake timeout
  expires
- **WHEN** the collection cycle processes it
- **THEN** no snapshot is stored for that vehicle
- **AND** its attempt is recorded as a failure with a wake-timeout reason
- **AND** the cycle continues to the other vehicles

### Requirement: Per-Vehicle Isolation And Attempt Recording
The telemetry capability SHALL record exactly one attempt per vehicle per collection cycle, with an
outcome of success or failure and a reason. A failure collecting one vehicle SHALL NOT abort the
cycle — every other vehicle SHALL still be processed. The capability SHALL retry a transient
failure at most once per vehicle per cycle before recording it as a failure.

#### Scenario: One vehicle's failure does not stop the others
- **GIVEN** three registered vehicles where the second fails to be captured
- **WHEN** the collection cycle runs
- **THEN** the first and third vehicles are captured and stored
- **AND** exactly one attempt is recorded for each of the three vehicles
- **AND** the second vehicle's attempt is recorded as a failure with its reason

#### Scenario: Every attempt is recorded regardless of outcome
- **GIVEN** a collection cycle over a set of registered vehicles
- **WHEN** the cycle completes
- **THEN** each vehicle has exactly one recorded attempt for that cycle
- **AND** each attempt carries the owning account id, the vehicle's Tesla id, the attempt time, an
  outcome of success or failure, and a reason

### Requirement: Expired Or Revoked Connections Are Isolated, Not Fatal
The telemetry capability SHALL treat an account with no usable Tesla connection (missing, expired
beyond refresh, or revoked) as a per-vehicle failure, not a fatal error. For each affected vehicle
it SHALL record the attempt as a failure with an unauthorized reason, and it SHALL continue
processing the remaining vehicles and accounts. It SHALL NOT abort the cycle, and it SHALL NOT reach
into the account module's internal state to alter it.

#### Scenario: An account with no usable connection is recorded and skipped
- **GIVEN** an account whose Tesla connection is missing or revoked, owning one or more registered
  vehicles, alongside other accounts with valid connections
- **WHEN** the collection cycle runs
- **THEN** each of that account's vehicles has an attempt recorded as a failure with an unauthorized
  reason
- **AND** no snapshot is stored for those vehicles
- **AND** the vehicles of the other, validly-connected accounts are still captured

### Requirement: Collection Spans All Accounts And Vehicles
The telemetry capability SHALL enumerate every registered vehicle across all accounts through the
account module's public interface, and SHALL process every enumerated vehicle in a cycle. It SHALL
obtain each account's Tesla credentials through the account module's public interface and SHALL NOT
read the account module's tables directly.

#### Scenario: Vehicles from multiple accounts are all processed
- **GIVEN** two accounts each owning registered vehicles, all with valid connections and online
- **WHEN** a collection cycle runs
- **THEN** every vehicle of both accounts has a snapshot stored
- **AND** every vehicle of both accounts has an attempt recorded
- **AND** the work list and the credentials were obtained only through the account module's public
  interface

### Requirement: Scheduled Unattended Collection
The telemetry capability SHALL run collection cycles automatically on an in-application schedule,
by default once per day at 03:30 local time, with the hour, minute, and timezone configurable. The
schedule SHALL be part of the running application (not an external OS scheduler). The scheduler
SHALL shut down gracefully when the process receives a termination signal.

#### Scenario: A cycle runs at the scheduled time
- **GIVEN** the poller running with its default daily 03:30-local schedule
- **WHEN** the scheduled time is reached
- **THEN** a collection cycle runs
- **AND** the scheduler arms itself for the next day's run

#### Scenario: The scheduler stops gracefully on shutdown
- **GIVEN** the poller running and waiting for the next scheduled time
- **WHEN** the process receives a termination signal
- **THEN** the scheduler stops waiting and the poller exits cleanly
- **AND** no new collection cycle is started after the shutdown begins

### Requirement: Latest Snapshot Read Port
The telemetry capability's read port SHALL return snapshots that include the TPMS tire
pressure fields for all four corners alongside the existing snapshot fields. The read port
SHALL also expose four value-receiver companion methods — one per corner — that derive the
tire pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch) from the stored bar value. These companion
methods SHALL return a nil pointer when the stored bar field is nil (preserving the
nil/not-reported distinction through the conversion), and SHALL return a non-nil pointer
to the derived PSI value otherwise. Callers SHALL NOT receive a loss of nil fidelity when
converting from bar to PSI. No new read method is introduced; the four TPMS fields ride on
the existing Snapshot returned by the existing read port methods.

#### Scenario: Nil fidelity is preserved through the bar-to-PSI companion conversion
- **GIVEN** a snapshot row for which TPMS pressure was not reported (NULL in the database)
- **WHEN** a caller retrieves the snapshot through LatestSnapshotsByAccount or
  SnapshotsByVehicleSince and calls any of the four PSI companion methods
- **THEN** each PSI companion method returns nil
- **AND** the caller can distinguish "not reported" from "reported 0.0 PSI"

#### Scenario: Non-nil bar value is correctly converted to PSI by the companion method
- **GIVEN** a snapshot row with a non-nil TPMS pressure value stored in bar
- **WHEN** a caller retrieves the snapshot through the read port and calls the PSI
  companion for that corner
- **THEN** the companion method returns a non-nil PSI value
- **AND** the returned PSI value is the bar value multiplied by the barToPSI conversion
  factor (14.503773773)

#### Scenario: Callers never access the telemetry database directly for TPMS data
- **GIVEN** any caller that needs to display or process TPMS tire pressure data
- **WHEN** it obtains that data
- **THEN** it does so exclusively through the Reader port interface (LatestSnapshotsByAccount
  or SnapshotsByVehicleSince), reading the TpmsPressure* fields on the returned Snapshot
- **AND** it imports no package from internal/telemetry/db

#### Scenario: Snapshot struct literals are not broken by the new TPMS fields
- **GIVEN** existing code that constructs a Snapshot struct literal by naming fields
  (not positionally)
- **WHEN** the four new TpmsPressure* fields are added to the Snapshot struct
- **THEN** the existing code continues to compile without modification
- **AND** the new fields default to nil (zero value for *float64)

### Requirement: Supercharger Session Ledger
The telemetry capability SHALL, on each nightly collection cycle, fetch the complete
Tesla-billed Supercharger and DC fast-charging session history for each connected account
and persist it as a durable session ledger. For each session the ledger SHALL store the
session identifier, the owning account id, the vehicle VIN, the site name, the country
code, the charge start and stop times, the billing type, the vehicle make type, the full
raw session payload (fees and invoices), and the following derived summaries: total energy
in kWh (derived from fees where unit of measure is kWh), total cost (sum of totalDue
across all fees), the session currency, and the overall paid status (true when all fees
are paid, false when any fee is unpaid). Derived summaries SHALL be NULL when no relevant
fees exist. A session that has already been stored SHALL be refreshed in place (upserted)
rather than duplicated, so that billing state changes (e.g. an unpaid session later
becomes paid) are reflected on the next nightly run. Sessions for VINs no longer
registered to the account SHALL still be stored with a NULL vehicle id.

#### Scenario: A new account's full Supercharger history is ingested on first run
- **GIVEN** an account with a valid Tesla connection and several historical Supercharger
  sessions not yet stored in the ledger
- **WHEN** the nightly collection cycle runs
- **THEN** every session returned by the Tesla charging-history endpoint is stored in the
  ledger
- **AND** each stored session carries the account id, the VIN, the site name, the country
  code, the charge start and stop times, the billing type, and the vehicle make type
- **AND** each stored session carries the full raw session payload including fees and
  invoices
- **AND** each stored session carries derived energy kWh, total cost, currency, and paid
  status computed from its fees

#### Scenario: A previously stored session whose billing status changed is updated
- **GIVEN** a session already in the ledger that was stored as unpaid on a prior run
- **WHEN** the nightly cycle runs and the Tesla endpoint now returns that session as paid
- **THEN** the ledger row for that session is updated to reflect the paid status
- **AND** no duplicate row is created for that session
- **AND** immutable fields (session identifier, VIN, charge start and stop times, site
  name, country code, billing type, vehicle make type, first-seen timestamp) are
  unchanged

#### Scenario: Energy and cost derivation from fees
- **GIVEN** a session with multiple fees where one fee has a unit of measure of kWh and
  another has a unit of measure of minutes
- **WHEN** the session is stored
- **THEN** energy_kwh is the sum of usage tiers from the kWh-denominated fee only
- **AND** total_cost is the sum of totalDue across all fees regardless of unit
- **AND** currency is taken from the currencyCode of the first fee
- **AND** is_paid reflects whether all fees are paid

#### Scenario: A session with no fees stores NULL derived summaries
- **GIVEN** a session returned by the Tesla endpoint with an empty fees array
- **WHEN** the session is stored
- **THEN** energy_kwh, total_cost, currency, and is_paid are all NULL
- **AND** the raw session payload is still stored

#### Scenario: A session for an unrecognized VIN is stored with NULL vehicle id
- **GIVEN** a session in the Tesla history whose VIN is no longer a registered vehicle
  on this account (e.g. the vehicle was sold)
- **WHEN** the session is stored
- **THEN** the session is persisted with the VIN set to the session's VIN
- **AND** the vehicle id (tesla_id) is NULL
- **AND** all other session fields are stored normally

#### Scenario: A charging-history fetch failure is isolated from snapshot collection
- **GIVEN** an account for which the Tesla charging-history endpoint returns an error
- **WHEN** the nightly cycle runs
- **THEN** the failure is counted in the cycle report's charging fetch failures counter
- **AND** the snapshot collection for that account's vehicles continues normally
- **AND** no Supercharger sessions are stored for that account in this cycle

### Requirement: Supercharger Session Read Port
The telemetry capability SHALL expose a read port that allows callers (the gateway, other
consumers) to retrieve Supercharger sessions without accessing the telemetry database
directly. The port SHALL provide two read methods: one returning all sessions for a given
account (scoped to the account, ordered newest-first, with a limit), and one returning
sessions for a specific vehicle within an account (also ordered newest-first, with a
limit). Callers SHALL receive an empty non-nil result when no sessions exist for the given
scope.

#### Scenario: Sessions are returned for an account ordered newest-first
- **GIVEN** an account with multiple Supercharger sessions stored across different dates
- **WHEN** the caller requests sessions for that account
- **THEN** all sessions belonging to that account are returned
- **AND** the sessions are ordered by charge start time, newest first
- **AND** the result is limited to the requested number of rows

#### Scenario: Sessions are returned for a specific vehicle ordered newest-first
- **GIVEN** an account with two vehicles, each having stored Supercharger sessions
- **WHEN** the caller requests sessions for one specific vehicle within that account
- **THEN** only sessions matching both the account id and the vehicle's Tesla id are
  returned
- **AND** the sessions are ordered by charge start time, newest first
- **AND** no sessions belonging to the other vehicle appear in the result

#### Scenario: Empty result when no sessions exist
- **GIVEN** an account with a valid Tesla connection but no stored Supercharger sessions
- **WHEN** the caller requests sessions for that account
- **THEN** an empty collection is returned
- **AND** no error is returned

#### Scenario: Callers never access the telemetry database directly
- **GIVEN** any caller that needs to display Supercharger session data
- **WHEN** it obtains that data
- **THEN** it does so exclusively through the SuperchargerReader port interface
- **AND** it imports no package from internal/telemetry/db

### Requirement: Cycle Report Charging Counters
The telemetry capability's cycle report SHALL include a count of Supercharger sessions
successfully upserted in the cycle and a count of accounts for which the charging-history
fetch failed. Both counters SHALL be zero when no sessions were processed and no failures
occurred.

#### Scenario: Cycle report reflects sessions upserted across all accounts
- **GIVEN** two accounts each with three new or updated Supercharger sessions
- **WHEN** the collection cycle completes
- **THEN** the cycle report's ChargingSessionsUpserted is six
- **AND** the cycle report's ChargingFetchFailures is zero

#### Scenario: Cycle report counts a charging fetch failure per account
- **GIVEN** two accounts where one account's charging-history fetch fails
- **WHEN** the collection cycle completes
- **THEN** the cycle report's ChargingFetchFailures is one
- **AND** snapshot collection succeeded normally for both accounts

### Requirement: Snapshot History Read Port

The telemetry capability SHALL expose a read port through which other modules (the gateway in
particular) can retrieve the **history** of stored snapshots for a single vehicle — all snapshots
captured at or after a caller-supplied instant — without accessing the telemetry module's database
tables directly. The port SHALL identify the vehicle by its account and its Tesla numeric id, and
SHALL return the existing `Snapshot` domain type (including all extracted typed fields and the raw
payload), ordered **oldest-first** by capture time. The window boundary is supplied by the caller
as an absolute instant (`since`, inclusive); the port SHALL NOT compute the window itself. Callers
SHALL receive an empty result (not an error) when the vehicle has no snapshots in the window. The
distance and range fields SHALL be returned in miles (the Tesla-native unit) with no kilometre
field on the returned type.

#### Scenario: History is returned oldest-first for a vehicle within its account

- **GIVEN** an account that has stored several snapshots for one vehicle across different
  collection runs, all captured at or after a given instant
- **WHEN** the caller requests that vehicle's snapshot history since that instant (passing the
  account id, the vehicle's Tesla id, and the instant)
- **THEN** every snapshot captured at or after the instant is returned
- **AND** the snapshots are ordered oldest-first by capture time
- **AND** all extracted fields (including odometer, battery level, and battery range) match the
  stored values for each snapshot
- **AND** the distance and range fields are returned in miles with no kilometre field on the
  returned type

#### Scenario: The `since` boundary is inclusive

- **GIVEN** a vehicle with a snapshot whose capture time is exactly the requested `since` instant
- **WHEN** the caller requests that vehicle's history since that instant
- **THEN** the snapshot captured exactly at `since` is included in the result

#### Scenario: Snapshots older than the window are excluded

- **GIVEN** a vehicle with snapshots both before and after the requested `since` instant
- **WHEN** the caller requests that vehicle's history since that instant
- **THEN** only snapshots captured at or after `since` are returned
- **AND** snapshots captured before `since` do not appear in the result

#### Scenario: Empty result when the vehicle has no snapshots in the window

- **GIVEN** a vehicle that has no stored snapshots at or after the requested `since` instant
- **WHEN** the caller requests that vehicle's history since that instant
- **THEN** an empty collection is returned
- **AND** no error is returned

#### Scenario: Per-account and per-vehicle scoping

- **GIVEN** two accounts that each own vehicles with stored snapshots, and an account that owns two
  vehicles
- **WHEN** the caller requests history for one account and one vehicle
- **THEN** only snapshots belonging to that account AND that vehicle are returned
- **AND** no snapshot belonging to another account, or to another vehicle of the same account,
  appears in the result

#### Scenario: Callers never access the telemetry database directly

- **GIVEN** any caller that needs to display or use a vehicle's snapshot history
- **WHEN** it obtains that data
- **THEN** it does so exclusively through the telemetry module's read port interface
- **AND** it imports no package from `internal/telemetry/db`
